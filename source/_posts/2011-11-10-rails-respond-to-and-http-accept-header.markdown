<p>
Rails has an API respond_to for determine the response body format. 
According to <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">api.rubyonrails.org</a>, "(Rails determines the desired response format from the HTTP Accept header submitted by the client.)"
</p>
<p>
However, browsers seem to have different strategy on writing the HTTP Accept header, (<a href="http://www.gethifi.com/blog/browser-rest-http-accept-headers">http://www.gethifi.com/blog/browser-rest-http-accept-headers</a>), would that be a problem?
